# Restaurant Reviews - Front-end Web Nanodegree

## About the project

This project simulates a real working environment. An incomplete code was provided and totally without accessibility. The goal was to turn the web application into a responsive and accessible page for as many people as possible. In addition, prioritizing the offline first (PWA) was one of the requirements required by Nanodegree.

## Steps to execute the project

* Run Restaurant-Review-00.zip and extract all files.
* Now is the time to emulate a local server. For this you will need to have python installed on your machine, if you do not have it, insert it.
* Now, on your terminal run the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" (without the quotation marks). If you're already using "port 8000" you can configure another port in the /js/dbhelper.js file.
* Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000 (change "8000" if you are using another port). Enjoy the web application.
